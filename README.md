a barebones api client with NASAâ€™s api. connect with the API and display information from that API

Travis is used - a .travis.yml file for the python app is added in assignment 1 to utilize Travis CI in conjunction with the github repo
This includes instructing the laguage used, the provider, the api key, and the project name under the cloud server.

Requirements.txt- these are the required components that are needed to have it built and deloped to be hosted.
This can be done by doing pip3 freeze to show the required compnents

I tried to deploy my app to a server like heroku

I used this source as reference:

Complication: As the travis build was successful, the deployment of the app didn't go well
Soultion: restart heroku

Alternative solution: check travis file, requirements text, or the python files
